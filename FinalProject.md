# Final Project
## Part 1
### The inital proposal for this project changed after reciving feedback in Part 2
Neighborhood Price Projection, Pittsburgh PA

Data source- www.zillow.com 
Historical data is available through searching for individual neighborhoods. 

Stakeholders and their roles: This visualization is designed to provide consumers with information about the stability of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, and economic projections for future growth. 

Project Summary: This project will involve scrubbing data from Zillow about 10 distinct Pittsburgh neighborhoods that represent the north side, south side, west end and east end. This data will be organized into a visual representation to convey the long term economic growth, indicating which neighborhoods are economically stable, or expected to experience growth in the near future. 

Project Structure: This project will initially focus on the economic growth of individual neighborhoods. I will then compare current/past economic growth, stability, and future growth. I will use graphs as visual aids. The entire project will be hosted on GitHub. 

Challenges: Data for every neighborhood in Pittsburgh varies slightly within a few records. I chose a selection of neighborhoods from representative geographic quadrants( north, south, east, west). I have chosen Brookline, Duquesne Heights, Penn Hills, Manchester, North Oakland, Homewood, Lawrenceville, Mount Washington, Perry North and Squirrel Hill because they are larger neighborhoods with data available for a sustained time period. 

Measuring Success: Success will be measured by how clearly the visualization can provide an economic snapshot of each neighborhood, and allow the reader to compare economic changes. The Pittsburgh housing market has experienced a boom in the past 5 years. However, selling prices are expected to decrease in some neighborhoods in 2019/2020. My goal is to provide the reader with specific information about how each selected neighborhood is expected to change, in order to make decisions about home purchasing. 

Initial Sketches 
I. Individual line graphs for each neighborhood (x10)

II. Line graph that highlights the neighborhoods with the highest growth rate. This graph will include representation of the growth of each neighborhood. However, the lines for most of the neighborhoods will be in grey, while the featured neighborhoods will be highlighted with a bold color. 

III. Line graph that highlights the most economically stable neighborhoods. This graph will include representation of the growth of each neighborhood. However, the lines for most of the neighborhoods will be in grey, while the featured neighborhoods will be highlighted with a bold color.

## Part 2

After receiving feedback that my inital story did not provide a specific call to action, I changed the direction of my project to focus on pollutant violations in Pittsburgh. 

### Data sources 

#### [Allegheny County Health Department](https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/Data-and-Reporting/Air-Quality-Reports/Air-Quality-Reports-and-Studies.aspx)

#### [Breathe Project](https://breatheproject.org/resources/air-pollution-sources/)

#### [Toxic Ten](http://toxicten.org/cheswick-power)

a. The target audience you hope to reach with your story;
The target audience for my story is residents of Pittsburgh who are affected by the pollution. 

b. Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview;
I chose to interview individuals who both know me, and colleagues who I do not have a consistent rapport with. My logic was that those who know me would be able to provide feedback as it relates to my overall communication goals. However, those who I do not communicate with often would be more likely to provide direct, unfiltered feedback. 

c. Your interview script; 
I used two different interview scripts for those I already have a dialogue with (1), and those I communicate with less often (2). 

1a. Thank you for agreeing to provide feedback about the following visual representation. I would like to review this representation to make the communication as dynamic and clear as possible. Would you mind providing feedback on how I could improve within this area. 

1b. After discussing this specific point, I asked the individual to provide feedback on any points relative to their experience of the representation. 

 2.Thank you for agreeing to provide feedback about the following visual  representation. I would like to hear about how you experience the representation. What do you think could be improved upon? 

In previous experiences receiving feedback, I have found individuals to readily provide positive feedback. I specifically asked for constructive feedback in order to convey that I would specifically like to improve this representation. 

d. The findings from your interviews, and changes made;

Receiving feedback was very helpful, and lead to making significant changes. I received feedback from two sources indicating that the story did not have a clear call to action. I initially chose to provide information about the housing market in Pittsburgh for home buyers. However, this plan did not ask the viewer to take a specific action. Ultimately I did not feel comfortable asking viewers to take a specific action based on the market because the decision to buy a house involves many more variables than can be comfortably represented within this project. My initial idea was more of a public service than a call to action. 

I realized that my decision to buy a house has been largely impacted by which areas of the city experience increasing pollution. I learned that Liberty, PA (a suburb past the East End), has been in violation of EPA standards from 2012-2017 (2018/19 data is not available yet). This information is both personally compelling and surprising, so I changed my story to represent the violation of PM 2.5 standards. 

In order to make this change, I had to use different data and obtained data about PM 2.5 violations through the Allegheny County Health Department: https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/Data-and-Reporting/Air-Quality-Reports/Air-Quality-Reports-and-Studies.aspx

I also received feedback from many people that I could use a higher economy of information within graphs. I had planned to use many small graphs, and ultimately this amount of information was not engaging for the viewer. The message I want to convey is simple; our neighbors in Liberty, PA are breathing in unacceptable amounts of PM 2.5, letâ€™s learn about this and take action to help them.

## Part 3
### Final Data Story

The intended audidence for my story is the general population of Pittsburgh. My story is designed to provide concise information about the PM 2.5 pollution in neighboring areas that affects Pittsburgh residents, in order to ask them to take action in decreasing this pollution. PM 2.5 pollution primarily comes from industral pollution.

When I moved to Pittsburgh, I was surprised to find that it was one of the US cities with the worst pollution. Moving from a larger city with a mugh higher population and industry, I assumed that due to it's population size Pittsburgh would not produce levels of pollution that are rountinely below EPA standards. I started to learn about pollution when my asthma became worse. My partner and I began searching for a house to buy through reading pollution maps. I kept having conversations with friends who were surprised to find that local PM 2.5 emissions rank at high levels, and have serious health effects. 

While designing this project, I found it most challenging to create a call to action. I found it important to focus on pollution because while there is a considerable amount of public information on this topic, I was still surprised to learn the rate at which it effects Pittburgh residents. I think discusing environmental actions can seem overwhelming because as a public citizen, the decision making about reguating these issues on a larger scale is out of my hands. However, there are actions we can take in favor of the environment like voting for politicians who have a track record of monitoring emission standards and supporting a decrease in the pollution of local communities. 

Another challenge I encountered was communicating about environmental regulations and standards to a wide context of people who have a mixed level of experience an knowledge in discussing these issues. Most people don't know what PM 2.5 is, or that the violation of EPA standards occurs though the number of days in which emissions are higer than the rate established by the EPA. For example, the air quality in Pittsburgh is measured through days in violation rather than jut a specific number. Within 60 seconds, I must bridge the insular language gap created by EPA standards and create a call to action. I decided to focus on a couple of main points within the short presentation without touching upon meausrement standards. The Shorthand page will be used to provide more in depth information about how PM 2.5 emissions are quantified.
