# Final Project
Final Project Proposal-Part 1
Neighborhood Price Projection, Pittsburgh PA

Data source- www.zillow.com 
Historical data is available through searching for individual neighborhoods. 

Stakeholders and their roles: This visualization is designed to provide consumers with information about the stability of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, and economic projections for future growth. 

Project Summary: This project will involve scrubbing data from Zillow about 10 distinct Pittsburgh neighborhoods that represent the north side, south side, west end and east end. This data will be organized into a visual representation to convey the long term economic growth, indicating which neighborhoods are economically stable, or expected to experience growth in the near future. 

Project Structure: This project will initially focus on the economic growth of individual neighborhoods. I will then compare current/past economic growth, stability, and future growth. I will use graphs as visual aids. The entire project will be hosted on GitHub. 

Challenges: Data for every neighborhood in Pittsburgh varies slightly within a few records. I chose a selection of neighborhoods from representative geographic quadrants( north, south, east, west). I have chosen Brookline, Duquesne Heights, Penn Hills, Manchester, North Oakland, Homewood, Lawrenceville, Mount Washington, Perry North and Squirrel Hill because they are larger neighborhoods with data available for a sustained time period. 

Measuring Success: Success will be measured by how clearly the visualization can provide an economic snapshot of each neighborhood, and allow the reader to compare economic changes. The Pittsburgh housing market has experienced a boom in the past 5 years. However, selling prices are expected to decrease in some neighborhoods in 2019/2020. My goal is to provide the reader with specific information about how each selected neighborhood is expected to change, in order to make decisions about home purchasing. 

Initial Sketches 
I. Individual line graphs for each neighborhood (x10)

II. Line graph that highlights the neighborhoods with the highest growth rate. This graph will include representation of the growth of each neighborhood. However, the lines for most of the neighborhoods will be in grey, while the featured neighborhoods will be highlighted with a bold color. 

III. Line graph that highlights the most economically stable neighborhoods. This graph will include representation of the growth of each neighborhood. However, the lines for most of the neighborhoods will be in grey, while the featured neighborhoods will be highlighted with a bold color.
