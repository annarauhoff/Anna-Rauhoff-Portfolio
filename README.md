This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! My name is Anna Rauhoff, and my pronouns are she/her. I am a student in the MPM program, and work full time as Assistant Director of Admission with the Office of Undergraduate Admission. I serve on the Financial Aid & Analytics Team, which manages the disbursement of Undegraduate Financial Aid Offers for incoming students. I will graduate in two years, and plan on continuting to work in higher education. I use currently use data visualtion to make predictions about workflow, represent historical information, and communicate about internal statistics. I enrolled in this course in order to develop my ability to communicate about issues or trends through data representation. I  enjoy creating graphs/charts etc., but would like to improve my ability to represent more complex issues. 

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling with my fianc√© and painting. In my spare time I can be found hiking, eating at Alquisiras Paleteria or house hunting. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to effectively represent data sets that contain more than 2 variables. I would also like to learn how to crique the representations that others create.

OIG Data Visualization #1
Data Journalist perspecive

From the perspective of a Data Journaist, I chose to highlight the primary increase in apprehensions; Family Unit apprehensions. This graph is designed the convey an increase in apprehensions for an article that takes a stance against apprehensions/ICE. I used a minimal color sheme with the goal of making the data clear and quick to understand. In order to convey a negative tone with regard to the increase specifically in family unit apprehensions, I used red.

DHS Analyst perspective

From the perspective of a DHS analyst, I chose to not highlight a specific population within the data. I used neutral colors for all populations, regardless of increase. I also chose to use the same title from the data chart, in order to simply convey the change in Family Unit apprehension instead of drawing attention to the increase.

Data Visualization Critique #2

Original Visualization

Critique

I appreciate the economy of information used within the original visualization. However, the format and use of color are distracting and prohibited me from engaging with this chart. In order to quickly convey the information provided in the chart, I paired down the color scheme while delineating the top five candidates from the others who polled signifcantly lower. My goal was for thereader to be able to quickly understand who the top 5 demoncrat candidates polling in New Hampshire are.

# Final Project
Final Project Proposal-Part 1
Neighborhood Price Projection, Pittsburgh PA

Stakeholders and their roles: This visualization is designed to provide consumers with information about the stability of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, and economic projections for future growth. 

Project Summary: This project will involve scrubbing data from Zillow about 10 distinct Pittsburgh neighborhoods that represent the north side, south side, west end and east end. This data will be organized into a visual representation to convey the long term economic growth, indicating which neighborhoods are economically stable, or expected to experience growth in the near future. 

Project Structure: This project will initially focus on the economic growth of individual neighborhoods. I will then compare current/past economic growth, stability, and future growth. I will use graphs as visual aids. The entire project will be hosted on GitHub. 

Challenges: Data for every neighborhood in Pittsburgh varies slightly within a few records. I chose a selection of neighborhoods from representative geographic quadrants( north, south, east, west). I have chosen Brookline, Duquesne Heights, Penn Hills, Manchester, North Oakland, Homewood, Lawrenceville, Mount Washington, Perry North and Squirrel Hill because they are larger neighborhoods with data available for a sustained time period. 

Measuring Success: Success will be measured by how clearly the visualization can provide an economic snapshot of each neighborhood, and allow the reader to compare economic changes. The Pittsburgh housing market has experienced a boom in the past 5 years. However, selling prices are expected to decrease in some neighborhoods in 2019/2020. My goal is to provide the reader with specific information about how each selected neighborhood is expected to change, in order to make decisions about home purchasing. 

Initial Sketches 
I. Individual line graphs for each neighborhood (x10)

II. Line graph that highlights the neighborhoods with the highest growth rate. This graph will include representation of the growth of each neighborhood. However, the lines for most of the neighborhoods will be in grey, while the featured neighborhoods will be highlighted with a bold color. 

III. Line graph that highlights the most economically stable neighborhoods. This graph will include representation of the growth of each neighborhood. However, the lines for most of the neighborhoods will be in grey, while the featured neighborhoods will be highlighted with a bold color.
