This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! My name is Anna Rauhoff, and my pronouns are she/her. I am a student in the MPM program, and work full time as Assistant Director of Admission with the Office of Undergraduate Admission. I serve on the Financial Aid & Analytics Team, which manages the disbursement of Undegraduate Financial Aid Offers for incoming students. I will graduate in two years, and plan on continuting to work in higher education. I use currently use data visualtion to make predictions about workflow, represent historical information, and communicate about internal statistics. I enrolled in this course in order to develop my ability to communicate about issues or trends through data representation. I  enjoy creating graphs/charts etc., but would like to improve my ability to represent more complex issues. 

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling with my fianc√© and painting. In my spare time I can be found hiking, eating at Alquisiras Paleteria or house hunting. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to effectively represent data sets that contain more than 2 variables. I would also like to learn how to crique the representations that others create.

OIG Data Visualization #1
Data Journalist perspecive

From the perspective of a Data Journaist, I chose to highlight the primary increase in apprehensions; Family Unit apprehensions. This graph is designed the convey an increase in apprehensions for an article that takes a stance against apprehensions/ICE. I used a minimal color sheme with the goal of making the data clear and quick to understand. In order to convey a negative tone with regard to the increase specifically in family unit apprehensions, I used red.

DHS Analyst perspective

From the perspective of a DHS analyst, I chose to not highlight a specific population within the data. I used neutral colors for all populations, regardless of increase. I also chose to use the same title from the data chart, in order to simply convey the change in Family Unit apprehension instead of drawing attention to the increase.
