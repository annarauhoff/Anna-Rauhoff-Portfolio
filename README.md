# About me
Hello! My name is Anna Rauhoff, and my pronouns are she/her. I am a student in the MPM program, and work full time as Assistant Director of Admission with the Office of Undergraduate Admission. I serve on the Financial Aid & Analytics Team, which manages the disbursement of Undegraduate Financial Aid Offers for incoming students. I will graduate in two years, and plan on continuting to work in higher education. I use currently use data visualtion to make predictions about workflow, represent historical information, and communicate about internal statistics. I enrolled in this course in order to develop my ability to communicate about issues or trends through data representation. I  enjoy creating graphs/charts etc., but would like to improve my ability to represent more complex issues. 

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling with my fianc√© and painting. In my spare time I can be found hiking, eating at Alquisiras Paleteria or house hunting. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to effectively represent data sets that contain more than 2 variables. I would also like to learn how to crique the representations that others create.
